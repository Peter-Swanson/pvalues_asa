# $P$-values Presentation (April 2016)

In March 2016, the American Statistical Association published an official 
statement on the meaning and use of $p$-values (https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.W0TumtJKguW). These notes summarize the 
ASA's statement and try to provide a non-technical example of what a $p$-value 
is and what it means. This deck was used as a presentation to the Credit Risk and 
Centralized Modeling divisions at a large US bank.
